# Square Eyes - Connecting Film-Lovers

<img src="/img/cross-course.jpg" width="600" alt="Square Eyes">

My first project. Improved over cross courses.

## Description

The project entailed creating an independent video streaming website where users can purchase high-quality videos directly from the people who make them.

This project began originally in Design by building a working prototype. 
<br>
It then progressed by building it in HTML and CSS.
<br>
Through later courses I improved it with focus on JavaScript, Content Management Systems and Interaction Design. 

Requirements of the project:

- Properly functioning responsive website
- HTML should be semantic and neat.
- CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Added later in cross courses)
- Headless WordPress API (Added later in cross course)
